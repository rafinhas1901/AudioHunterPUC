# Aplication usage

When you open the app, you'll first see an audio recorder interface, it's our interface that records the audio and shows if its loud or not.
You can stop recording if you want too, but we always start recording when you enter on the app.
If the sound is too loud we'll send a notification for you and show an advice on app ui (if the application is on screen)
